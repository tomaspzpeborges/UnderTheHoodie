# Under the Hoodie

An application written in Flutter/Dart that allows the user to write a statement in a hoodie and order it. The application is connected to a backend Google Firebase Database and uses the Stripe API for payments, and also uses Google Cloud Functions for handling more sensitive information.


Notes for using this project:
-Specific keys for Google Firebase Database abd Stripe API were removed, so add your own. Code in Google Cloud Functions was not updated so you have to write your own.
